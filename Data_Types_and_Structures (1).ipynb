        "     -> Tuples ensure data integrity in Python by being immutable, which means their values cannot be changed after creation.

        "\n",
        "    In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, Python uses the hash of the key to decide where to store the value. This makes lookups, insertions, and deletions very fast on average.\n",

        "\n",
        "    -> Yes, lists can contain different data types in Python 3. A list can hold a mix of integers, strings, floats, booleans, and even other lists or objects. This is because Python lists are dynamic and do not require all elements to be of the same type.\n",

Second, dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, which helps keep the data organized and easy to understand. Unlike lists, you don’t need to remember the position of data, just the key name. Third, dictionaries are better suited for representing structured data where each item has a unique identifier.\n",
